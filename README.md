# collocation
A repository with a python implementation of Orthogonal Collocation by Villadsen and Stewart (1967) for solving second order boundary value problems.

See one simple example and a real world problem in the notebook example_collocation.

This was developed as a part of the modeling in the published article: "Simulation and optimization of axial-flow and radial-flow reactors for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene based on a heterogeneous kinetic model," Chem. Eng. Sci., vol. 244, p. 116805, 2021. doi:10.1016/j.ces.2021.116805.

The code is uploaded on ResearchGate and can be cited linked to doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.17223.78240.
